# IndianCricketerImageClassification

In this project I will be creating a Indian Cricketers Image Classification.

It will start from data scrapping using selenium from google. The file is present in the [code](/code/data_collection.ipynb) folder.

Once the data is collected, using python I will try to clean the data.
Once the automated cleaning of data is done.
I will verify the images manually to make sure we have clean data.
The python file for data cleaning and is present [here](code/data_cleaning.ipynb).

After cleaning the data, I will create and train the model or image classifier. (In progress).
